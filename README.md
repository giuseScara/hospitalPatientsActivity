# Hospital Patients Activity

A hospital is running a trial to see if their patients age 20-40 are falling below the recommended level of activity:
<ul>
<li>150 minutes of moderate intensity activity, or</li>
<li>75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity, or</li>
<li>a proportionate mix of both, e.g. 25 minutes of vigorous and 100 minutes of moderate.</li>
</ul>
